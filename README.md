### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work at [SMA Technologies](https://smatechnologies.com).  We build automation and orchestration software to simplify our customers lives and give them time back in their days.
- [We am hiring!](https://smatechnologies.com/careers)
- I cut my teeth as a C# dev.
- I love software, the open source community, and seeing what others are creating!
- Love cooking and creating recipes; I think my wife and my ðŸŒ® fusion tacos ðŸŒ® are the best.
